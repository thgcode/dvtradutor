This is not the repository for synapse, this is the repository for the synapse
debianization effort.

This repository includes:
* synapse (upstream) SVN code: http://www.ararat.cz/synapse/
* debian package patch: https://sourceforge.net/p/synalist/feature-requests/18/

You can get .deb files resulting from the code here seen on [debs](https://github.com/marado/synapse/tree/debs) branch.
